# spos Speech

## Prerequisites

### Enable the Speech API


### Set Up to Authenticate With Your Project's Credentials

### Test

Before running tests update the following environment variable with the service
account:

    GOOGLE_APPLICATION=service-account.json

This environment variable will be used to update the service account used here
`app/src/main/res/raw/credential.json`.

Run tests by using:

    gradle test

### Build signed release

*This step is optional.*

This sample uses ProGuard to decrease the number of methods generated by the gRPC library. It is
enabled by default for release build. If you want to build it, change the path, alias and passwords
of the keystore file specified in gradle.properties.
